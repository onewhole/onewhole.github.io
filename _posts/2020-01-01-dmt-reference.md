## Sourcing

## Extraction

### DMT extraction

In the following AB (acid to base) teks, the idea is to breakdown the plant cells by reaching a PH of around 3 (ACID) with vinegar, then force the DMT molecules separate by reaching a PH of around 12 (BASE) with lye. The you want to extract the DMT using a non polar solvent and collect the DMT **freebase**.

#### Things you need:

    Large Stainless-Steel pot
    Powdered bark of your choice
    2 x 1qt Mason jars with lids or equivalent glassware
    Kosher Salt
    Lye
    5% White Vinegar
    Naphtha
    Distilled or at least filtered water
    A strainer to strain your bark*
    Pipette
    Glass precip dish or jar
    Glass or Wood Stir Sticks

*I use a coarse stainless steel filter to catch the majority of the particles, then landscaping fabric to filter the resulting liquid. You can filter as much or as little as you want, but the less floaters you have the better. I recommend using a Buchner funnel if you plan on filtering it until clear.

#### Preparation

1. Powder your bark is with a blender with some water
2. Put your bark in a large stainless-steel pot.
3. For every 100g of bark add:
    - ½ gallon (2L) of water,
    - ¼ cup (75g) of Kosher Salt
    - ¼ cup (60ml) white vinegar
4. Bring this to a boil. This doesn’t smell great so keep that in mind.
5. Boil the mixture until the liquid has been reduced by half. Remove from heat and let it cool.
6. Strain the bark mixture and place the water back into the pot**\***. Continue boiling until the liquid has been reduced to about 2 cups (500ml) per 100g of bark you started with. 
    - **\***Repeat this boiling process with fresh water (and salt + vinegar) until it no longer produces DMT (3-4 more boils). Save this liquid and reduce as before. Store the wet powdered bark in the freezer for later use
7. Once the liquid has been reduced to the desired amount, pour into a 1qt Mason jar and let it cool completely in the fridge.
8. In a second glass Mason Jar (or a 500ml Beaker) measure out 200ml of distilled water. Slowly add 100g of Lye to the water, mixing constantly with a glass or wood stir rod until dissolved.
9. Let the Lye / Water mixture cool down to room temperature, then put into the fridge for about 30-45 minutes with your jar of soup.
10. Remove the jars from the fridge. Pour the Lye / Water into the 1qt jar containing your bark soup.
11. Mix thoroughly and let sit for a few minutes. Warm up the mix if it doesn't separate
12. Measure out 100ml of your chosen solvent
13. Pour the solvent into the soup mix and screw on the lid.
14. Shake the jar for 5-10 minutes, stopping frequently to check for any pressure buildup.
15. Let the contents settle and separate. This can take a few minutes
16. Use a pipette to siphon off the solvent into a collection beaker.
17. Pour this into your evaporation / freeze precipitation dish.
18. Put the lid on the dish and place in the freezer for 12-24 hours. Pour off the remaining solvent and collect your crystals.
19. Repeat steps 12 – 16 until the bark is no longer producing. You can combine pulls or precipitate them individually.

**NOTE** - In step 4-6 you can just use a single boild to perform a partial extraction, otherwise just mix all the 4 boils (4L) and reduce to 500ml.

 <summary><h4>Cybs Salt tek - Higher yield</h4></summary>

The most strigthforward tek, easily Cybs' Hybrid ATB 'Salt' tek posted on [DMT-Nexus](https://wiki.dmt-nexus.me/Cybs%27_Hybrid_ATB_%27Salt%27_Tek)

</details>

In the following SB (straight to base) tek the idea is sligthly different

### MAOIs extraction

Here I will be considering just harmaline (one of the most commonly used MAOI). Either get some capsule or extract it from Syrian Rue (as an example)

## Consumption

The are different way to consume the product

### Pipe

### "The Machine"

### Vaporizer

### Changa/Leaf enhancement

*Requires MAOIs*

Changa consists in dissolving the DMT in MAOI containing herbs whereas leaf enhancement requires to assume MAOI first and then smoke herbs where the DMT was dissolved

### Pharmahuasca

*Requires MAOIs*

Assume MAOI then assume DMT **fumarate** orally, usually in capsule or in tea
